# Game of life
![](images/cells.png)

This project is my implementation of well known programming concept, the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

During my experimentation with this cellular simulation I decided to add an unusual but interesting feature - a heatmap.
